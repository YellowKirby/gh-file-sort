# gh-file-sort

A browser extension to control the order in which files are displayed in Github pull requests and similar file-comparison views.

## Status

Very early development and just barely functional, but needs a lot more love.

## Development

```sh
# one-time setup
npm install

# build + watch the extension to be loaded in browsers
npm start

# (optional) run Storybook to iterate on UI components
npm run storybook
```
